RISC-V picorv32 processor porting to KV260 + PYNQ
=================================================

Luca Durante, Last update: August 6th, 2023

Host PC: Windows 10 Professional + Vivado 2022.1   KV260 board: UBUNTU 2022.04.2 + PYNQ 3.0.1

RISC-V picorv32 processor design files ported to KV260 AMD/Xilinx board under UBUNTU + PYNQ.

I started from: 

https://github.com/drichmond/RISC-V-On-PYNQ based on PYNQ 2.1+ Vivado 2017.4.

This repository demonstrates a library for evaluating RISC-V Projects from the paper "Everyone's a Critic: A Tool for Evaluating RISC-V Projects": 
https://kastner.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/admin/fpl18-everyones_critic.pdf 

but I found a more up to date fork from https://github.com/drichmond/RISC-V-On-PYNQ:

https://github.com/Siudya/RISC-V-On-PYNQ

I used the last one, based on PYNQ 2.4 Vivado 2018.3, as real starting point for the port to KV260 + PYNQ.
